As a beginning quilter, I decided, what’s  the best quilt to start with? Ah ha…I know! I should design my own.  I don’t know what I was thinking. This quilt took me a couple years to complete, and a down right new respect for learning to quilt.

## Quilting Process

 I finished it as I started it, being the first quilt I free motion quilted.   It turned out better than I expected, and Waylon loves it!

## What I learned

I wish I could tell you the step by step instructions to  creating this piece, but all I can tell you is that the inside square was created by me cutting fabric, screwing up, and trying to salvage what I had just done, because hot damn fabric is expensive.  So, if you learn anything from this pathetic tutorial is my name is Rhiannon, don’t be like Rhiannon.  Well, at least the 2014 Rhiannon.  Now, the 2018 me is half a lung down and has my shit together.  That was fun, just to write.  Enough shit to make a plan before starting the quilt.

However, I did record the process of me trying to accomplish a wood grain quilting pattern.  I sort of accomplished it.  Not to bad for my first time.

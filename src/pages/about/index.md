# Who is Behind Cuttin Scrap?

## Rhiannon

She is the Mega Brain behind this operation.  All of the writing and video editing is done by her.  Rhiannon is going to stop referring to herself in the 3rd person.  I am a strong, independent, sarcastic, emotional, loving, hard-headed individual.  I have been through so much in my 28 years on this planet and have been transformed throughout the years to evolve into a research based, primarily google, fantastic person.  I love creating.  I love gift giving, but am absolutely terrible at waiting to give these gifts.  I desire immediate satisfaction.  I believe in the 5 Languages of Love in all aspects of my life and am a pretty large fan of Dave Ramsey.  

I am a survivor on multiple levels and have been diagnosed with not one, but two rare disorders whose "ribbons" are zebra print for rareness.  One could say I am zebra squared.  I am facing the challenges of surviving with Neuroendocrine Cancer of the Lung.  I take every day as a new day, literally, my short term memory sucks.  I write everything down mostly on the traditional pen and paper.  I am a people pleaser and confrontation is one of my greatest fears along with spiders, and snakes.  I make lists over and over again.  I talk to myself and give inanimate objects names.

As a designer I love the more modern with rustic look.  I like to tweak patterns to make them my own, and I strive for perfection, but sometimes give things the good old fuck it, and move on.

I am an open honest person.  I tell you how it is from my eyes.  I live with the effects from this Cancer on a daily basis, and suffer from depression and anxiety.  I am eternally coping.  I plan things to the death.  Seriously, I have planned my funeral.  This is how it makes it ok in my mind., but never be accepted.  I can live with ok.  Giving control to a situation where all control has been eliminated helps.  

I am the wife to  Waylon.  We met as High School Sweethearts/Janitors and have been each others only true significant other in our lives since 2006 and married in 2011.  We could star in our own ROM COM. We have two beautiful children Wyatt and Ayla.  These kids give us a run for our sanity and may cause us to need a drink here and there, but are ultimately the reason we wake up in the morning.

This my open book.  You can choose to join the party, turn the page, and dance like no one is watching, or not.  Either way thank you for taking time out of your busy day to read a little about me.  If you would like dig deeper, please refer to my personal blogs.

## Waylon

Waylon is the developer on all things website and analytics.  He is not only my husband, but is quite possibly the nicest person I have ever met.  Waylon is a quiet person.  He hides his emotions and pushes on through all the crazy things life has thrown at him.  He has a passion for writing code that goes back to college.  He has always been one to be constantly learning. 

Waylon has a Mechanical Engineering degree.  He started out in the workforce in his field. Through perseverance and hard work he transferred into the Computer Analytics field without spending a dime. He is one that can solve a problem with patience, a keyboard, and some software.  He is always improving himself.  He isn't afraid of much, and kills all my spiders for me. :)  

I may be the face of this business, but Waylon is the only reason I am able to do this.  He is my foundation.  He excels at everything he does.  His skills in the Analytic world are outstanding.  As you can see from looking at this website, his website building skills are also quite BA.

He designed this website while putting up with my OCD tweaks.  I took an image in my head and very poorly described it to him, and he was able to produce this beautiful modern website.   If you too would like a website built by Waylon visit the [Contact Us](www.cuttinscrap.com/contact) page.

# **What are the different levels of Cuttin Scrap?**

## Projects:

This if fairly self explanatory.  I create projects with my sewing machine and film the process to create a YouTube story.  My goal is to have fun, and make the videos closer to movies than Documentaries.  I want my audience to enjoy watching the videos, but also have a chance to learn from what I have done, which is where the Project Blogs come into place.

In the Project Blogs I describe what materials I used to create the project along with any mistakes I made and subsequently have learned from during the journey.

## Personal:

With my life being on the hectic side I also feel that I have enough personal experience that someone else might benefit from what I have gone through.  The blog is more or less my public personal diary.  I am putting myself out there for the good of all my followers.  I want you all to benefit from the different stories I have had to learn from the hard way.  My ultimate goal is to make life just a little bit easier for someone else.

Something new I am attempting to start are podcasts.  These podcasts are to fulfill a lifelong dream of becoming a motivational speaker.  I have never felt like I had a story that could motivate someone else until now.  I have learned to embrace the chaos, and would love to bring you on the journey.  I plan to make a podcast always be something you leave feeling like you can tackle any challenge headed your way.

## Charity:

With everything I have been through in my life. I have been given lots of love.  People from all areas of my life have given me a hand to help pull me up and keep me upright.  This is where I want to give something back.  I am not sure what the exact reach of this movement will be, but at soon as I get that aspect figured out, I will let you all know.  I want to make a difference, and I can't do  it without the love and support of each and everyone of you.
